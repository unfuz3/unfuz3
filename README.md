# Hey there!

## Who am I?
I'm just an internet user interested in programming. That's it.

## My skills?
Some years in **Python** experience. Basic **Lua** and **Java**.

## My projects?
They're just some script or discord bots. My latest one is AsciiCam, a python script to convert images or a webcam photo to ascii art.
