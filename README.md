# Hey there!

## Who am I?
I'm just an internet user interested in lots of programming stuff, and I try to learn **as much as possible**. That means that my projects, code and knowledge may be simple, but that's just for now.

## My skills?
3 years in **Python** experience. Basic **Lua** and **Java** stuff. Done a basic, yet useful **REST API**, in Python, SQLite, and Flask.

## My projects?
At the moment, all the project, scripts, code, and everything I've worked on while learning hasn't been published or uploaded anywhere. That's why I have this GitHub account, to **share** my future progress with hopefully nice new projects.
