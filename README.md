# Hey there!

## Who am I?
I'm just an internet user interested in programming. That's it.

## My skills?
Some years in **Python** experience. Basic **Lua** and **Java**.

## My projects?
At the moment, all the project, scripts, code, and everything I've worked on while learning hasn't been published or uploaded anywhere. That's why I have this GitHub account, to publish some of the finished or WIP stuff.
